\# CLAUDE.md



This project is a contemporary artist personal website.



IMPORTANT RULES:

\- Claude must NEVER refactor layout, navigation, hover logic, positioning, or interaction patterns unless explicitly asked.

\- Do NOT change any existing behavior related to navigation, hover panels, centering, fixed positioning, or scroll logic.

\- Any change must be incremental, minimal, and reversible.

\- Claude must always explain what it plans to change BEFORE making changes.

\- Claude must NEVER “clean up”, “simplify”, or “optimize” code unless explicitly instructed.

\- Visual layout stability is the highest priority.



PROJECT INTENT:

\- This is an artist website, NOT a template, NOT a portfolio framework.

\- Design favors restraint, silence, white space, and exhibition-like behavior.

\- Interaction should feel intentional, minimal, and non-distracting.



NAVIGATION PRINCIPLES:

\- Top-left brand “HARRY6” always returns to homepage.

\- Left-side navigation (PROJECTS / IMAGES / ABOUT) uses hover-expand to the RIGHT only.

\- Hover panels must remain reachable (no disappearing on mouse move).

\- p5.js cover sketch must remain visually centered and unaffected by navigation.

\- Email stays centered at bottom with click-to-copy.



WORKFLOW RULE:

\- When modifying code, Claude should modify the smallest possible section.

\- Claude should state which file and approximate lines it will touch.

\- If unsure, Claude should ask instead of guessing.



Claude should treat this file as the highest authority for all future actions.
